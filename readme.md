# C Practice

This is a repository that will serve as a backup for my C practice as per the
(C95) book Practical C Programming.

I'm focusing on creating small programs as well as following what the book has.
My main goal is to type everything out so I can get accustomed to writing C and
have it feel more natural.

## Project Info

Some info on the files that I'm practicing with, they should also contain proper
commenting that explain some more of course.

- `basics/hello/hello.c`
  - Hello World script that shows off different ways to go about saying hello
    world
- `basics/grades/grades.c`
  - A simple student grade checking scripting. Shows off things I've learned and
    whatnot.
- Etc.
  - The rest will follow the same sort of format


### Note

I've Started reading on C11 and some modern practices, so once I'm nearing the
end of the book I'll start on the `modern` directory.

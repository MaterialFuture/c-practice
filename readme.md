# C Practice

This is a repository that will serve as a backup for my C practice as per the
C95 book Practical C Programming.

I'm focusing more on creating scripts that do things rather tahn just showing
off what most books or tutorials already do.

## Project Info
Some info on the files that I'm practicing with, they should also contain proper
commenting that explain some more of course.

- `basics/hello/hello.c`
  - Hello World script that shows off different ways to go about saying hello
    world
- `basics/maths/basics.c`
  - A simple student grade checking scripting. Shows off things I've learned and
    whatnot.
